This is the repository for the data for our paper "EmotionArcs: Emotion Arcs for 9,000 Literary Texts" at the 8th Joint SIGHUM Workshop on Computational Linguistics for Cultural Heritage, Social Sciences, Humanities and Literature (LaTeCH-CLfL 2024), St. Julians, Malta.

It is a dataset comprising emotional arcs and intensities from over 9,000 English novels, assembled to understand the dynamics of emotions represented in text and how these emotions may influence a novelâ€™s reception and perceived quality.
